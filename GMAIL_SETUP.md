```properties
# Replace these values with your actual Gmail credentials:
spring.mail.username=your-actual-email@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your-app-password-from-step-2

# Replace with your actual email for the "from" address:
app.mail.from=your-actual-email@gmail.com
```

## ðŸš¨ Security Notes
- **Never commit your actual email credentials to Git**
- Use environment variables for production:
  ```bash
  export SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
  export SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
  ```
- The app password is different from your Gmail password
- Keep your app password secure and don't share it

- Check spam folder if emails don't appear in inbox
- Backend logs will show success/failure status

Set `app.mail.enabled=false` in application.properties to return to development/mock mode.
